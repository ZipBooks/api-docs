# Introduction

Welcome to the ZipBooks API!

<aside class="warning">
  We're so busy getting new features out to all of our users, this documentation can quickly become
  outdated and may change with the rapidly evolving needs of our customers. The API will change in
  the future in ways that are incompatible with the current API. If you choose to use the API, you
  do so at your own risk.

We format our responses according to JSON API. You can get more info here: <a href='http://jsonapi.org'>http://jsonapi.org</a>
